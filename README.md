# 🤖 SmartAI Agent – Autonomous AWS AI API Executor

🚀 **Live Demo:** [SmartAI Agent Web App](https://tusharb2007.github.io/SmartAI-Agent/)

## 🌟 Overview

**SmartAI Agent** is an autonomous AI-powered API executor built entirely on **AWS**, combining the power of **Amazon Bedrock**, **Lambda**, and **API Gateway**.  
It allows users to send natural language instructions and receive structured, intelligent responses — generated and reasoned by **Claude (Bedrock)** in real time.

This project was created for the **AWS Hackathon**, showcasing how serverless architecture and generative AI can create autonomous systems that reason, execute, and respond intelligently.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> “Transform human language into actionable logic — powered by reasoning AI.”

SmartAI Agent bridges the gap between **language understanding** and **API execution**.  
It lets developers and users simply describe what they want, and the system figures out how to deliver it.

## 🏗️ Architecture

User (Web UI)
↓
API Gateway (HTTP endpoint)
↓
AWS Lambda (smartapi_lambda.py)
↓
Amazon Bedrock (Claude Model)
↓
AI-generated structured response


**Architecture Flow Summary:**

1. The **user** interacts through the **web interface** (`index.html`).
2. The **API Gateway** receives the request as an HTTP POST endpoint.
3. The **AWS Lambda** function (`smartapi_lambda.py`) processes and forwards it.
4. The **Amazon Bedrock Claude model** performs reasoning and generates a response.
5. The **final AI-generated structured output** is returned to the user in real time.

**Key Components:**
- 🧠 **Amazon Bedrock** – Claude model for reasoning and response generation  
- ⚡ **AWS Lambda** – Serverless backend for invoking the Bedrock model  
- 🔗 **API Gateway** – Secure interface for external requests  
- 💬 **Frontend (HTML + JS)** – Chat-style web interface for real-time interaction

## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| AI Model | Amazon Bedrock – Claude |
| Backend | AWS Lambda (Python) |
| API Routing | Amazon API Gateway |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages |

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. User enters a natural-language instruction in the web interface.  
2. The request is sent via **API Gateway** to the **Lambda function**.  
3. Lambda passes it to **Amazon Bedrock (Claude)** for reasoning.  
4. Claude interprets the intent, generates a structured, actionable response.  
5. The result is displayed instantly in the browser.

## 🧠 Example Use Cases

- 🗣️ Convert natural language requests into API-ready outputs  
- 🧩 Build dynamic, reasoning-driven backend workflows  
- 🤖 Extendable to multi-agent systems or knowledge retrieval pipelines  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add **multi-agent collaboration** for task chaining  
- Integrate with **DynamoDB** for memory and context storage  
- Implement **authentication** and **rate limiting**  
- Add **voice-based interface** for voice-to-API execution
